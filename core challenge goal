1. Core Challenge Goal

A “lead” (interested student) comes in.

They might book a trial class.

They can then convert into an active student.

They may have status changes later (paused, canceled, etc.).

Different student types exist (adult, child, family).

Business rules + integrations (Stripe for payments, SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS, Zoom/Calendar for scheduling) are involved.

The repo expects  to use Playwright + TypeScript, with good design (Page Object Model, helpers, test data factories).
