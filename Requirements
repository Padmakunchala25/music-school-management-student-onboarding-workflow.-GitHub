Student types & flows

Adult student: standalone onboarding.

Child student: must be linked to a parent account.

Family account: multiple students linked under one account.

👉 Tests should cover each scenario (adult alone, child with parent, adding new child to an existing family).

State transitions

Lead → Trial → Active → Paused/Cancelled.

You’ll want to assert correct state changes at each step.

Example: after booking a trial, student should not yet be “active”. Only after payment & confirmation should they become active.

Business rules

Prevent duplicates (no two accounts with same email).

Trial → Active transition requires payment.

Cancellations might trigger emails/SMS.

Integrations

Stripe: validate that payment flow triggers.

SendGrid: email notification sent.

Twilio: SMS reminder goes out.

Google Calendar/Zoom: trial/lesson scheduled correctly.

Page Object Model: separate page selectors/actions from tests.

Test data factories: generate unique emails, names, etc. for test runs.

Helpers/utilities: for waits, assertions, API mocks.

Config: environment URLs, credentials, API keys (never hard-coded).
